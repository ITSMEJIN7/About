            <p>
HOUSE OF TAHO is the brainchild of Elena, a native of Cagayan de Oro, together with three friends with initial capitalization of ₱250,000. The idea was to sell a product that is familiar to the people but needs to be elevated to cater and fit to mall-goers.
<br>
That idea started the rise of TAHO ATBP, which opened its first kiosk at Gaisano City Mall, Cagayan de Oro City in December 2015.
<br>
                With Elena’s leadership, determination, and dedication, TAHO ATBP revamped its operations, branding, and started operating under new management under Soy Lab Corp. together with her husband, sister and brother in-law.
<br>
On May 2017, the company started the rebranding process by changing its name to HOUSE of TAHO, even the color theme, logo, cart/kiosk designs were improved to cater and meet to the needs of the growing customers.
